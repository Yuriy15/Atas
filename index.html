   <strong>ATAS</strong><p> is the title song from the Eagles' album of the same name
			and was released as a single in February 1977. It is one of the best-known songs of the
			album-oriented rock era. Writing credits for the song are shared by Don Felder, Don Henley, and
			Glenn Frey. The Eagles' original recording of the song features Henley singing the lead vocals
			and concludes with an extended section of electric guitar interplay between Felder and Joe
			Walsh. The song has been given several interpretations by fans and critics alike, but the
			Eagles have described it as their "interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles". In the 2013
			documentary History of the Eagles, Henley said the song was about "a journey from innocence to
			experience...that's all".
